SARS-CoV-2_serology.csv
A csv file containing measurements of antibody responses from our Luminex MAGPIX multiplex assay.

Fig1_single_AB.R
An R script for preliminaryof antibody responses, plotting ROC curves, calculating AUCs, and calculating correlations.

Fig2_multi_AB.R
Analysis of the assocation between multiple measurements of antibody response and SARS-CoV-2 infection status. A random forests classification algorithm (with cross-validation) is used.

Fig3_AB_kinetics.R
R script taking the posterior outputs of the C++ code for antibody kinetics and plotting antibody levels over time and sensitivity.

Fig4_kinetic_classifier.R
R script for model predicted sensitivity over time using a single antigen (spike) and multiplex combinations analysed with random forests algorithms. Depends on C++ output.

Fig5_sero_surveillance.R
R script for statistical assessment of the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity on serological surveys.

SupFig1_crosspanel_validation.R
R script for quantification of uncertainty of serological classification.

SARSCoV2_IgG_antigen_combination.xlsx
Excel spreadsheet detailing classification performance of all combinations of IgG responses to 7 SARS-CoV-2 antigens using a random forests classifier.

Source.cpp
C++ code for Bayesian statistical inference of anntibody kinetic models.

com.cpp
linpack.cpp
randlib.cpp
randlib.cpp
Randlib library for generation of random numbers for MCMC algorithm.

Chain_diagnostics.R
R script for plotting the outputted MCMC chains from C++.
